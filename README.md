Gofore junior dev preassignment - Calculate the number of steps for a robot to reach destined point

## What's it doing
The idea is to go through a map, which you load from a text file, and calculate steps that the robot (S) has to take to reach (E).
If the robot hits an obstacle (#) it turns right and continues moving forward. The starting direction is up.

When you open a compatible file (two examples included), the map is passed to a 2D array.
The first line of the map file is a map code presumambly for checking the answer.
